Weight Chamber for Solace AI

This module defines the WeightChamber class responsible for assigning
"tension" scores to incoming hypotheses or pieces of data.  In the Solace
architecture the Weight chamber inverts the usual filtration order: rather
than filtering out contradictions, it prioritises them.  Data that challenges
existing models is given higher weight to encourage exploration.

Key features:

- Uses a Beta(2, 2) prior to initialise tension scores, avoiding overâ€¯confidence.
- Accepts arbitrary data inputs and returns weighted entries.
- Records epistemic debt (amount of unresolved contradiction) alongside tension.
- Provides methods to update the prior distribution as new evidence arrives.

This is a skeleton implementation intended to be expanded in later phases.
