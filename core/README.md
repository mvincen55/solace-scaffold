# Core (Sovereign Nucleus)

This folder contains the immutable code and ethical constants of Solace.  It holds the tri‑chamber reasoning pipeline skeleton, initial Beta(2,2) priors, the mission mandate, and the protected logic for identity and alignment.  Changes to files in this directory require tri‑species quorum approval and must be signed.
